            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>During my one-month internship at Digi Serve, I worked on two key projects. The first involved designing a graphical interface for their team member management system, where I applied and improved my UI/UX design skills. The second project was focused on redesigning a page for an existing software developed by Digi Serve, allowing me to further hone my design abilities while understanding how to integrate new elements into an established system. 
            </p><p>Through this experience, I enhanced my problem-solving skills, learned how to incorporate feedback effectively, and developed greater proficiency in tools like Figma. The internship also increased my confidence in tackling real-world design challenges and gave me a deeper understanding of how design can contribute to product development.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Although the team has a versatile approach, having someone specialized in UI/UX design would make design projects easier and more efficient. Digi Serve receives only a few projects and maintains some of their previous ones, so they do not require a full-time UI/UX designer. However, to improve their product development process, they could benefit from a dedicated UI/UX designer to handle the design and logic aspects of their projects.</p>

        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>The skills and experience I gained from this internship will be valuable as I continue to develop my career. Working on a real project with real users has given me the confidence to handle complex design challenges. I plan to apply the problem-solving skills I developed in future design projects, and I now feel more equipped to understand and respond to client feedback.</p>
        <p>This internship has also reinforced my interest in user-centred design. I learned that good design goes beyond aesthetics; it involves making products functional, accessible, and meaningful for users. This understanding will guide me as I work on future projects and continue to refine my design approach.</p>
